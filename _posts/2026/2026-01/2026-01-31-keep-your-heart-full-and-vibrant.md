昨日和老同事们聚餐，聊起了各自的近况。

一位我印象中非常和善，总是笑呵呵的老哥说自己辞职了，因为公司太清闲了，他呆不住。我以为他是要努力奋斗了，想听听他的规划。结果他说好几个月以来每天在出租屋里睡觉，一天到晚都不怎么下床，只想摆烂什么都不干。

我的直觉是这位老哥可能心理上出了一点问题。

我想和他好好聊聊，想劝他给自己设一个小目标，哪怕不上班，也要让身体动起来，进而让心灵丰富起来。人一旦精神上空虚，远比身体劳累更加可怕。

我准备了一大堆话，但最终没说出口 —— 人微言轻，我即使说了又有什么用呢？

终究要他自己走出来。

芸芸众生，都不容易，只愿他未来都好吧。

Yesterday I had dinner with some former colleagues and we caught up on our recent lives.

One colleague who I remember as very friendly and always smiling told us he had quit his job because it was too idle and he couldn't stand staying there. I assumed he was going to work hard and asked about his plans. To my surprise, he said that for months he's been staying in his rented room, sleeping most of the day and barely getting out of bed —— just letting himself give up and do nothing.

My instinct was that he might be having some psychological issues.

I wanted to talk to him properly and suggest he set a small goal for himself —— even if he doesn't return to work, he should at least get his body moving so his mind can be nourished.Spiritual emptiness is　often more frightening than physical exhaustion.

I had a whole speech prepared, but in the end I didn't say anything —— my words seemed powerless. Ultimately he has to pull himself out of it.

Life is hard for everyone; I just hope things go well for him.
