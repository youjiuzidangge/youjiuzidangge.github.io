上一篇博客到现在已经过去 2 周了，明显是有一些懈怠了。

所以今天必须写点什么，但是想了一下，这几天也确实没有任何的想法。如果没有什么特别的想法，那么我应该写什么呢？

1. 谈谈这两周我做了什么？
2. 谈谈我近期的计划？

##### 那么这两周我做了什么

这两周白天都是熟悉新公司的环境和项目，没什么可以多说的，公司对保密性这一块要求也比较高，还是不要踩红线了。晚上的话，就第一天确实干了活，通过 v0.dev 把之前想写的网站终于算是整体完整了，但是还有好多细节需要补充。

##### 近期的计划

1. 购买一个新的背包
2. 完善个人网站
3. 购买域名，云服务等
4. 完成个人网站的部署

Two weeks have passed since my last blog post —— clearly, I've been slacking off a bit.

So today, I have to write something.But after thinking it over, I realized I haven't had any particular ideas lately. When I don't have anything specific to say, what should I write about?

1. Maybe I can talk about what I've done over the last two weeks？
2. Or maybe I can share some of my upcoming plans？

##### What I've been up to

Over the past two weeks，I've spent most of my daytime getting familiar with the new company —— its environment and the projects. There's not much I can share there though, since the company places a strong emphasis on confidentiality.I'd rather not cross any lines.

As for the evenings，on the very first night I actually got something done —— I used v0.dev to finally put together a rough version of a personal website I had in mind. It's more or less complete in structure, but there are still lots of details to refine.

##### Upcoming plans

1. Buy a new backpack
2. Improve the personal website
3. Purchase a domain and cloud hosting
4. Deploy the personal website on the Internet
