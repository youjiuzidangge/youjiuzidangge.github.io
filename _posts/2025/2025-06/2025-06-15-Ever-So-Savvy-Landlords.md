上周刚租了一个房子，电梯房，房型正正方方，非常通透，明亮。 但是，它的电器，比如冰箱，空调，热水器，燃气灶等都非常老旧。

和房东磨了半天，房东坚持一样电器都不给换。

但是最后我还是租下来了，因为这个房子的位置和电梯对我来说是不可缺少的，毕竟是给老人租的。

回过头来说，如果是我自己，我肯定不会租的。因为我觉得房子本身住的是否舒服，和房子的装修关系并没有那么大，反而和电器这种家电关系非常大。

所以我其实是不太理解房东的思路，现在家电都很便宜，就算把上面所有的都换一遍，都抵不了一个月的房租。但是如果这些家电都是新的，那么对租客来说体验就完全不一样。这样的话，整个房子明显就更有竞争力，尤其是现在租房市场惨淡的情况下。

但是实际上，房东就是宁愿空的，甚至好几个月也不愿意做这方面的让步。我遇到过好几个房东都是如此的。

让我来比较一下这两种情况下的优势和劣势：

1. 同样的价位下，竞争力更强，甚至可以适当提升价格
2. 房东付出了更多的金钱成本

现在更多的房东选择不更换，说白了还是市场压力不大，以及房东的自私与眼光短浅而已。

Last week, I rented an apartment in a building with an elevator. The layout is perfectly square, very open, and bright. However, the appliances —— such as the fridge, air conditioner, water heater, and gas stove —— are all quite old.

I negotiated with the landlords for quite a while, but he firmly refused to replace any of them.

In the end, I still decided to rent it because the location and having an elevator are indispensable for me，especially since it's for my elderly parents-in-law.

Looking back，if it were for myself，I probably wouldn't have rented it。To me，the comfort of living in a place depends less on the interior decoration and much more on the appliances.

So I don't quite understand the landlord's mindset。Nowadays, appliances are relatively inexpensive；even replacing all of them wouldn't cost more than one month's rent。But if the appliances were new，the tenant's experience would improve significantly. That would obviously make the apartment more competitive，especially in the current weak rental market。

Yet in reality，many landlords prefer to keep their units vacant for months rather than make such improvements。I've encountered several landlords with this attitude.

Here's a quick comparison of the pros and cons:

1. At the same rental price，the apartment would be more competitive，and the landlord could even raise the rent slightly。
2. The landlord would incur higher upfront costs

Most landlords nowadays choose not to upgrade because the market pressure isn't strong enough，and frankly，due to their short-sightedness and selfishness.
