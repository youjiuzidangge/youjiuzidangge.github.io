最近一直在听“炒股养家”老师的心得，感觉很有道理，但是稍微仔细想一下，却是没有办法落实下来。因为我个人不太可能把绝大多的时间和精力投入到股票这件事上，他的那些模式不投入大量的时间成本，是不可能“悟道”的。 但我又认为炒股是穷人获取财富一个必不可少的手段。所以我只能从大方向学习他的理念，但是细节的落实就要根据自己的交易习惯和模式经行调整。

今天我想谈谈一个点 —— 股票的模式。

总的来说，我的交易方式是超市战法，即买入大量少数金额的股票，然后卖出盈利的，持仓亏损的。但是近段时间发现一个问题，即明明超过一半的股票上涨，大盘也是翻红的，但是我的持仓却是亏损的，上涨的股票数比例明显不如大盘。

为什么会出现这个现象，我认为即没有抓住“股票的模式”。

最近的股票模式：

- 高位股票持续上涨，然后大跌一段时间，再次持续上涨
- 长期下跌的股票止跌，反弹，震荡上升
- 小幅上涨的股票持续上涨，上涨持续不停

那么我要做的就是，顺应上面的模式，做到快速切换，要果断应对。

- 针对已经大有盈利的票，当出现大跌的时候要快速止盈观察，如果又再次起飞的迹象，要立即入手
- 跟踪长期下跌止跌的票，在震荡上升过程中入手
- 入手持续小幅稳定上涨的票，不要恐高，大涨到下跌时出手

Recently, I've been listening to insights from a trader known as Chao Gu Yang jia. His ideas make a lot of sense, but when I think about them more deeply, I realize they‘re hard to put into practice.That's because I simply can't dedicate the majority of my time and energy to trading.The kind of pattern recognition and intuition he talks about requires an enormous time investment to truly "get it."

That said, I still believe stock trading is an essential path to building wealth —— especially for those starting with limited means.So, my approach is to learn from his core principles while adapting the details to suit my own trading habits and style.

Today, I want to talk about one key concept: stock patterns.

Generally speaking, my strategy is what I call the "supermarket method" —— I bug a large number of stocks，each with a small position。I then sell off the winners and continues holding the losing ones. 

However， I recently noticed a problem：even though more than half of the market was rising and the overall index was in the green，my portfolio was still in the red。The number of rising stocks I held was clearly lower than the market average.

Why did this happen? I believe it's because I failed to recognize and follow the prevailing stock patterns.

Here are some of the recent market patterns I've observed:

- High-flying stocks continue to rise, then experience a sharp drop, followed by another round of sustained growth。
- Long-declining stocks stabilize，rebound， and begin a choppy upward trend。
- Stocks with slow，steady gains continues rising without significant pullbacks.

Based on these patterns, my strategy should be to adapt quickly and respond decisively:

- For stocks that have already yields strong profits, I should take quick profits when a sharp drop occurs.If they show signs of rallying again, I must re-enter without hesitation.
- Monitor stocks that have been in long-term decline and begin to stabilize —— enter during the early stages of their choppy recovery.
- For stocks that are steadily climbing, I shouldn't fear buying at a high level.Ride the trend and sell only after a significance surge followed by signs of reversal.
