我在刷抖音和知乎的时候，喜欢看一些社会纪实类的视频和文章，以及大家的讨论。并且会根据当前的社会现状，反思如果是我，我应该怎么做，我的最优解法是什么。不过，无论我有没有想法，我都不会去评论和点赞。

之所以如此，主要是基于两点：

1. 我不希望被大数据记录自己的观点与喜好，随着技术与算法的进步，甚至能预测我下一步的行为。如果被有心人利用，这是一件非常可怕的事。
2. 我从小被教育为信奉中庸，自保之道。只要我不评论不点赞，就不会产生任何风险。

但是现在我的想法改变了。

如果我不发声，不为我支持的观点点赞，那么其实就是我放弃了自己的舆论阵地，将世界拱手让给了那些我不喜欢的人。

另外，我也期望多认识一些和自己有相似观点的朋友。

When I browse TikTok and Zhihu， I enjoy watching realistic documentaries and reading social commentary, along with the discussions that follows. I often reflect on the current state of society and think about what I would do if I were in those situations —— what the optimal solution might be. However, regardless of whether I have my own thoughts, I never leave comments or give likes.

There are two main reasons for this:

1. I don't want my opinions and preferences to be tracked by big data. As technology and algorithms continue to evolve, they may even be able to predict my next move. If such data were exploited by malicious actors, it would be terrifying.
2. I was raised with the values of moderation and self-preservation.As long as I neither comment nor like anything, I believe I can avoid potential risks.

But recently, my perspective has changed.

If I never speak up or show support for the ideas I believe in, then I'm essentially abandoning my voice in the public sphere, leaving the conversations to those whose views I disagree with.

Besides, I also hope to meet more like-minded people by engaging more actively.
