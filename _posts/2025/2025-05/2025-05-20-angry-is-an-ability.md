今天在知乎上看到一个帖子，如果你孩子在学校被霸凌怎么办？

有一个人回答了自己的经历，去和校方掀桌子，他们不负责任，你就干脆把学校闹翻，让学校出名，让正常的课都上不下去。

这个想法给了我一个启发，如果是我，我做的到这样吗？我的回答是，我很可能既想不到这样做，也做不到。

从小到大，我属于一个讲理但同时脾气也不是那么好的人，从小学到初中，打架不在少数。而整个高中就打过一次架。到了大学没打过架，反而表现的处处忍让，给人一副好欺负的模样。

为什么会有这么大的变化？我认为一个重要的点在于，国内的教育一定程度把人驯化了，失去了反抗的精神。

一个合理的教育，我认为应该是：

`提升见识与思维能力，而同时要保留身而为人的天性`

这里，就应该包含这么一种能力，不要瞻前顾后，尤其是面对不公的时候，一定要有玉石俱焚掀桌子的勇气。而这就是你的统战价值，以及上桌谈判的根本。

Today，I came across a post on Zhihu: What would you do if your child is being bullied at school?

One person shared their experience —— they confronted the school aggressively.If the school was irresponsible，they would escalate the situation，stir up enough trouble to disrupt classes and make the school notorious.

This response struck a chord with me.If I were in the same situation，could I do the same？Honestly，I probably wouldn't even think of reacting that way，let alone act on it。

Growing up，I've always been someone who believes in reasoning but also have a bit of a temper。I got into quite a few fights in primary and middle school。In high school，just one。By the time I got to college，I never fought again —— instead，I became overly accommodating，giving off the impression that I was easily pushed around。

What caused such a drastic change？I believe a key reason lies in how our education system, to some extent, tames people —— it strips away their spirit of resistance。

In my view，a proper education should do this：

> Broaden your vision and sharpen your thinking —— while preserving your core human instincts.

And that includes the ability to act without hesitation in the face of injustice。The courage to flip the table when necessary —— to risk it all if it means standing up for what’s right。That，ultimately，is your leverage。That's what gives you a seat at the table。
