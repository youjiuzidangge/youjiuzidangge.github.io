今天面试官指出了我一个问题，即我在回答问题的时候习惯去解释，扯一大堆。而面试官期望的是我明确精炼的回答。

我其实知道我一直有一个这样的毛病，这个大概要追溯到我高中养成的一个不太好的习惯。

它的底层其实反应了两点，第一，不够自信；第二，讨好型人格。

这两点很好解释，因为不够自信，怕我的逻辑有缺陷，所以通过解释来完整我的逻辑。

因为怕别人听不懂，所以愿意非常详细的讲解所有的细节点，而这就是典型的讨好型性格，怕别人误会。

那么，应该做到怎么样呢？

只做总结性描述，不做解释。

如果对方需要解释，再解释。

Today,the interviewer pointed out a weakness in my communication：I tend to over-explain my thoughts，often going into unnecessary detail。What they were really looking for were clear and concise answers。

This is actually a habit I've been aware of for a long time，likely developed during my high school years。

At its core，this behavior reflects two things about me：a lack of confidence，and a people-pleasing personality。

It's easy to example this。Because I'm not confident enough，I worry that my logic might be flawed —— so I try to explain everything thoroughly to cover all the bases。

And because I'm afraid of being misunderstood，I tend to over-elaborate，which is a typical trait of someone who wants to please others。

So，what's the right approach？

I should focus on giving only summary-level answers，without diving into explanations unless they’re specifically requested。
