最近失业在家，生物钟已经开始有些紊乱了，晚上总是睡不着觉。

睡着睡着，突然就下意识去拿起手机刷一会，也没有具体相干的事，这里刷刷，那里看看。

需要解决这个问题，那就是睡前把手机放的远远的。

Recently，I lost my job and have been staying at home。My biological clock has become a bit messed up，and I often find it hard to fall asleep at night。

Sometimes，while trying to sleep，I subconsciously reach for my phone —— not for anything in particular —— just aimless scrolling through apps。

I know I need to fix this。The solution is to keep my phone far away before going to bed。
