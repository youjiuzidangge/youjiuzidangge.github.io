我有一个毛病，讲话非常急躁，语速比较快。而且，容易讲着讲着就脱离了主题，甚至是忘记了自己最初想要表达的意思。

在一些场合，尤其是社交类，或者是谈判类，这是非常吃亏的。

必须针对性的慢慢改善这个问题，具体做法如下：

第一，每次讲话，语速要稍微慢一点，或者说一旦自己加速，就主动停下来不要讲。

第二，每次讲下一段话，要思考一下中心主题，脱离了主题，就不要继续下去了。

I have a bad habit: I tend to speak very quickly and impatiently. Also, I often go off-topic while talking, sometimes even forgetting what I originally wanted to say.

In certain situations, especially social or negotiation settings, this can be a serous disadvantage.

I need to work on improving this issue step by step. Here's how：

1. "First, whenever I speak, I should try to slow down. If I notice that I'm speeding up, I should consciously pause and stop talking for a moment"

2. "Second, before starting the next part of the conversation，I should think about the main topic。If I find myself going off-topic，I should stop and not continue down that path"
