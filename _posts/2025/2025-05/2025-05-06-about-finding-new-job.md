### 我的近况 My Current Situation
失业已经一个月了，从开始的兴奋到中间的有点疲惫，以及到现在的有点麻木了。我需要整理清楚自己的思路。

---
It has been a month since I lost my job.I went from feeling excited at first, to somewhat exhausted in the middle，and now I‘m feeling a bit numb。I need to organize my
thoughts。

---

### 就业情况 Employment Status
我最想做的还是全栈工程师，为什么是全栈？因为不想受制于人，受制于市场，而全栈意味着什么都可以做，是给自己的未来多一个选择。就这一个月看来，全栈工作岗位是有的，但主要还是 react/vue + node.js。偏偏这并不是我的强项。虽然美其名曰，我还是做了好几年的全栈，但是我的技术栈更加偏向于后端即 go,ruby 等，react 和 nodejs 虽然做过，但是并不精通。不过话说回来，到底什么算作精通？工作中又用得到多精通的技术？就我这8年左右的开发经验来说 ，软件开发的趋向是越来越简单了。以前是各种真正的技术大牛造轮子，现在又有各种大模型的辅助。未来呢？说远了，其实就我看来，至少我的前端技术还是堪一用的，但是奈何有2个面试没过，没过的原因总结下来还是基础不牢靠，即准备的不充分。

What I truly want to do is work as a full-stack engineer。Why full-stack？Because I don't want to be dependent on others or restricted by the job market。Being full-stack means I have the flexibility to do a bit of everything —— it gives me more options for the future。

Over the past month，I've noticed that full-stack roles are available，but they mostly focus on React/Vue with Node.js，which happen to be areas I’m less confident in。Although I've technically worked as a full-stack developer for several years，my strengths lie more in backend technologies like Go and Ruby。I've used React and Node.js before, but I wouldn't to say I'm highly proficient。

That said，what really counts as being “proficient”？And how deep does technical expertise need to be in a real job？From my 8 years of experience，I've seen software development become increasing simplified。In the past，top engineers built complex systems from scratch。Now，we have powerful AI tools to assist us。Who knows what the future holds？

Anyway，back to the point —— personally，I believe my fronted skills are sufficient for most jobs。Unfortunately，I failed two interviews recently， and I've come to realize the main reason was my shaky fundamentals and lack of thorough preparation。

至于纯后端的岗位，感觉真正招人的不多，而且后端的面试明显要比前端难上一个甚至不止一个等级。单单后端考的这些算法，就是真的令人头疼。这里其实是一个很奇怪的现象，而且这个现象从我入行开始其实就有了。就是针对中高级岗位，明明后端难于前端，但是前端的薪资往往还比后端高，而且岗位还多。为什么会出现这个现象？我的想法是因为前端是真正靠近用户端的，即是可以直接决定用户要不要付费的，那么自然钱途要更广大一些。

---

As for pure backend roles，my impression is that there aren't that many genuine openings。And honestly，backend interviews are clearly a level——or even several levels —— more difficult than frontend ones。Just the algorithm questions alone are enough to give you a headache。

This is actually a strange phenomenon, and it has existed since I first entered the industry。For mid-to senior-level positions，backend roles are generally more technically demanding than frontend ones。Yet， frontend developers often earn higher salaries and have more job opportunities。

Why does this happen？My guess is that frontend work is much closer to the end user。It directly affects the user experience and can even influence whether a customer is willing to pay —— so naturally， it tends to generate more business value and therefore offers better prospects。

记得很久以前，看到了某乎上一个哥门介绍自己从后端转前端，并强调 JavaScript 是未来的趋势，当时并不以为然，现在看来确实是一语中的。虽然说前端技术一直在更新，貌似更新的很快，但是无论是哪个库，甚至说 node，本身都脱不开 js 本身。如果对 js 有足够深的研究，那么知识更新起来其实也没有那么难，本质都是换汤不换药的东西。

---
I remember a long time ago，I came across a post on Zhihu where someone shared their experience of switching from backend to frontend，and emphasized that JavaScript was the future。At the time，I didn't really buy it —— but looking back now，it turns out he was absolutely right。

Frontend technologies have evolved rapidly over the years， and at first glance，it might seem like everything is changing all the time。But in reality，no matter which framework you’re using —— or even if it's Node.js —— it all revolves around JavaScript at its core。If you have a solid understanding of JavaScript，keeping up with new technologies isn't that difficult。Most of the time，it's just a new wrapper around the same core concepts。

### 如何找工作 How to find a job
1. 去大公司还是小公司？
* 尽可能的去大公司，刚毕业的时候真的是被忽悠瘸了。我在大公司被离职，还有 n + 1，小公司怕是毛都没有。

2. 降薪 or 不降薪？
* 我是不愿意降薪的，至少前 3 个月是不考虑的。为什么？第一，降薪意味着卷，今天我卷别人，未来别人是不是也要来卷我，不能助长这种不良风气。甚至，夸张了的说，这个是对所有劳动阶级的背叛。第二，降薪意味着走下坡路，降下去容易，但是涨上来就难了。因为一定程度上，薪资也体现了一个人的价值，或者说技术含量。随着经验的丰富，你拿的薪资，本身一定程度就反应了你的技术水平。这点我不确定公司角度是怎么考虑的，但我感觉一个良性的企业，优先会去找一个和自己岗位工资匹配的候选人， 而不是去找一个远低于自己提供薪资的候选人。

3. 全栈、后端、还是前端？
* 前面其实已经提到了现在市场的趋势，那么显然现在再死磕后端是不明智的。所以我首选全栈偏前端，再全栈偏后端，再前端，再后端。

---
1. Big company or small？
* Go for a big company if you can.When I first graduated，I was naive and got talked into joining a smaller company.Looking back, that was a mistake.If you're laid off by a big company，you‘ll at least get some severance pay —— maybe N+1.But in a small company？You might walk away with nothing。

2. Accept a pay cut or not？
* Personally，I'm not willing to take a pay cut —— at least not within the first three month of job hunting。Why？First，accepting a lower salary just feeds the toxic cycle of undercutting others。Today I take less，tomorrow someone else will take even less。It's race to the bottom——and in a way，it's a betrayal of all workers。Second，a pay cut often marks the beginning of a downward trend。It's easy to go down，but much harder to climb back up。Salary reflects not just your market value，but also the depth of your technical expertise。With more experience，your compensation should reflect your skills。I don't know exactly how companies see it，but in my view，a healthy company would prefer candidates whose salary expectations match the role，rather than someone severely underpaid。

3. full-stack，backend， or frontend？
* As I've mentioned earlier，the current market clearly favors frontend skills。So sticking purely to backend roles isn't a smart move right now。My order of preference would be：full-stack leaning fronted，the full-stack leaning backend，then frontend， and finally backend。

### 更远的规划  Future Plans

1. 学习英语，找工作应该放眼世界，而不是国内
2. 要成立自己的公司，做自己的项目
3. 关注其他行业信息，比如开店，摆摊等

本来就想写一点的，没想到又写这么多。今天思绪还是有点乱的，但是写的时候，又一定程度拓展了自己的想法，还不错。

---
1. Keep improving my English —— when job hunting，I should think globally， not just focus on the domestic market
2. Start my own company and work on my own projects
3. Explore other industries and opportunities，like opening a store or running a street stall。

I originally didn't plan to write this much。My thoughts were a bit scattered today，but as I started writing，it actually helped me organize and expand my thinking。Not bad at all。
