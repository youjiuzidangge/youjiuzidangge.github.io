我在某乎上看到一个提问，觉得很有意思和启发，所以记录下来。

问：“孩子想要一个玩具，但这个玩具真的很贵，超出了一般家庭的承受范围，该怎么跟孩子说比较妥当？”

答（大致意思, 取自魏坤琳教授的例子）: 

魏教授：“来，看看价格吧。买东西的时候，首先要看看价格，想一想你愿不愿意花这么多钱买。”
大女儿：“这上面写着 698 元。”
魏教授：“对，这个价格比爸爸穿的毛衣还要高，你觉得花这些钱值得吗？”
大女儿：“值得呀，爱莎公主的裙子呢！”
魏教授：“好，如果你特别想要的话，就用你的钱买吧！”

小女孩一听可以买，立即就答应了。
回到家后，小女孩立刻搬出存钱罐，把所有的钱倒出来数，一共是239块钱。
她一算，还差好几百，就去找魏教授：
“爸爸我钱不够，只有239块，你帮我出一些呗”

魏教授听完后，立刻大方的说：“行，我出一半”

小女孩计算了一下，眼珠一转说：
“还差110块，怎么办呢？”

魏教授立刻“贴心”地给女儿出主意： “你每个星期有 10 块钱的零花钱，如果把这些钱都攒起来，大概过两三个月就够了。”

在接下来的时间里，小女孩真的就把零花钱全攒起来，一分没花，刚好在快到圣诞节的时候攒够了钱。

当他们再去商场的时候，发现那件裙子在打折，6折就能买。

但神奇的是 ——
小女孩并没有买裙子，而是买了一个公主皇冠，只花了100多块，还说：钱要省着花。

魏教授感慨：“哈哈，自己攒的钱，孩子更节约。攒钱买的东西，也会更加珍惜。”

I came across an interesting question on Zhihu.I found it quite inspiring, so I decided to jot it down:

Question: "If your child wants a toy but it's really expensive —— beyond what an ordinary family can afford —— how should you explain it to them?"

Answer(paraphrased from Professor Wei Kunlin‘s example):

Professor Wei: "Come, let's look at the price.When you buy something, the first thing you should do is check the price and think about whether you're willing to spend that much money on it."
Older daughter: "It says 698 yuan."
Professor Wei: "Right. That's more than what your dad's sweater cost.Do you think it's worth it?"
Older daughter: "Of course —— it's Princess Elsa's dress!"
Professor Wei: "Alright. If you really want it, buy it with your own money."

When the girl heard she could buy it, she agreed at once.
At home she emptied her piggy bank and counted a total of 239 yuan. Realizing she was a few hundred yuan short, she went to Processor Wei and said, "Dad, I don't have enough —— I only have 239 yuan. Can you help me?"

Professor Wei heard this and immediately said generously, "Okay —— I'll pay half."
The little girl calculated quickly, her eyes lighting up, and said: "I'm still 110 yuan short, what should I do?"
Professor wei immediately gave a thoughtful suggestion: "You have 10 pocket money each week. If you save it all, in about two or three months you'll have enough."
Over the following weeks she really did save every bit of her pocket money and spent none; by the Christmas was near she saved enough.
When they went back to the mall, they found the dress was on sale —— it could be bought at 60% of the original price.
But surprisingly ——
The little girl didn't buy the dress; instead she bought a princess crown for just over 100 yuan and said: "We should be careful with money."
Professor Wei laughed and remarked, "Ha —— when children save their own money, they become more frugal. They also cherish what they buy more."
